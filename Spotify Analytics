# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle
# I then created a table and inserted the Spotify data into the table
# Following, I performed analytics on the data using SQL

#Creating the table: 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#The Spotify Data .csv inserted into the table

#Finally, I explored the data using the following SQL:

#1. What is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#2. Who are the artists to the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10:

#3. Who are the top 15 artistis based on average track popularity?

SELECT artist_name, avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg(popularity) desc
LIMIT 15;

#4. What artist released the longest song?

SELECT distinct artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms in (SELECT max(duration_ms) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata);


#5. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT avg(danceability),track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity desc;

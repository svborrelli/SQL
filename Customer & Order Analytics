#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID' ;

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID' ;

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID' ;

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct Product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC limit 1;

SELECT Product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product,SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT
count(distinct customers.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT location, product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
